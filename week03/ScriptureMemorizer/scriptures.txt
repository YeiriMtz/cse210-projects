1 Nephi 3:7|And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.
D&C 14:7|And, if you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God.
